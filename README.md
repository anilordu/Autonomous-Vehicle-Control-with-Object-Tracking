# Autonomous Vehicle Control with Object Tracking
In this project, an autonomous vehicle that tracks objects has been designed using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ development board. 
The OpenCV library has been used for object tracking.
The GPIO library has been used to provide the necessary PWM signals for controlling the motors.

The following hardware components are utilized:
- 4-Wheel Drive Car Kit: Vehicle kit with 4 DC motors.
- Pi Camera: The image has been captured with the Raspberry Pi camera module.
- 9V Battery: Voltage has been supplied to the motors.
- 10000mAh Power Bank: It has been used for powering the Raspberry Pi.
- L298N Motor Driver Module: It has been used for the control of DC motors.

In this project, tracking has been performed for the blue-colored object with its position determined on the horizontal axis.
If the object is on the left, the motors on the right move forward, and the motors on the left move backward.
If the object is on the right, the motors on the left move forward, and the motors on the right move backward.

The final version of the project.
